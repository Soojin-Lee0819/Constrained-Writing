# Convert English to Korean Using Numbers

##

I wanted to 

Choosing text was difficult. I have decided


Some challenges were met. Two language, although both use alphabet system, are vastly different in how they are put together. While English is linear, Korean is rather a block-based language. There were punctuations that are used specifically used for English text such as "apostrophe".

Considereing these, I have developed a technique where any English letter can be converted to Korean without an exception. 

The end result doesn't make any sense in Korean. Although readable, it is a text that doesn't make logical sense. However, it was still fascinating to see how English alphabets can be converted to Korean alphabets and generate new meaning.
