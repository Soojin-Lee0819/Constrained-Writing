# Convert English to Korean Using Numbers

For WEEK 1, I explored differnet constrained writing technqiues - a literary technique in which writer is bound by some condition that forbids certain things or imposes a pattern - such as snowbal, lipogram, prisoner's constraint, palindromes, univocalism, and mathew's algorithm. 

During ideation stage, I decided to invent writing techniques that involves English and Korean. As I read and write Korean and English fluently, I am familiar with both English Roman Alphabet and Korean Hangeul Alphabet. Although English and Korean are two very different language with unique writing system, I wanted to challenge by inventing a creative technique that converts English text to Korean text.

Here are some of the ideas and considerations I had:

1) English has upper-and lower-case system - Korean doesn't
2) English alphabets are written linear from left to right, while Korean is in block system. 
3) There are punctuations that are used specifically used for English text such as "apostrophe".

Considereing these, I have developed a technique where any English letter can be converted to Korean using numbers.

The end result doesn't make any sense in Korean. Although readable, it is a text that doesn't make logical sense. However, it was still fascinating to see how English alphabets can be converted to Korean alphabets and generate new meaning.
