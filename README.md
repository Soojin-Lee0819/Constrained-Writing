# Convert English to Korean Using Numbers

### Constrained Writing Techniques

For WEEK 1, in class we have explored differnet constrained writing technqiues - a literary technique in which writer is bound by some condition that forbids certain things or imposes a pattern. Some examples we looked at are the snowbal, lipogram, prisoner's constraint, palindromes, univocalism, and mathew's algorithm technqiques. 

### Ideation

As I am fluent in Englisha and Korean, I wanted to invent a constrained writing technique that involves English and Korean. I wanted to challenge coming up with a creative technique that converts English Roman Alphabets to Korean Hanguel Alphabets. 

Here are some thoughts and considerations I had as I was developing a system:

1) English has upper-and lower-case system - Korean doesn't.
2) Both English and Korean are written/read left to right.
3) Korean letters are written in syllable blocks.

4) "apostrophe" is used specifically for English but is never used in Korean.

Considereing these, I developed a technique that uses number to convert the Text written in English Roman alphabets to Korean Hangeul Text.

The converted Korean Text is this:



Although it is readable, it is a text that doesn't make logical sense. However, it was still fascinating to see how English alphabets can be converted to Korean alphabets and generate new meaning.
