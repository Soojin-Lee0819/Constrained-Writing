# Convert English to Korean Using Numbers

### Constrained Writing Techniques

For WEEK 1, in class we have explored differnet constrained writing technqiues - a literary technique in which writer is bound by some condition that forbids certain things or imposes a pattern. Some examples we looked at are the snowbal, lipogram, prisoner's constraint, palindromes, univocalism, and mathew's algorithm technqiques. 

### Ideation

As I am fluent in Englisha and Korean, I wanted to invent a constrained writing technique that involves English and Korean. I wanted to challenge coming up with a creative technique that converts English Roman Alphabets to Korean Hanguel Alphabets. 

Here are some thoughts and considerations I had as I was developing a system:

1) English has upper-and lower-case system - Korean doesn't.
2) Both English and Korean are written/read left to right.
3) Korean letters are written in syllable blocks.

4) There are punctuations that are used specifically used for English text such as "apostrophe".

Considereing these, I have developed a technique where any English letter can be converted to Korean using numbers.

View this project below to understanad how the system works.

The end result doesn't make any sense in Korean. Although readable, it is a text that doesn't make logical sense. However, it was still fascinating to see how English alphabets can be converted to Korean alphabets and generate new meaning.
